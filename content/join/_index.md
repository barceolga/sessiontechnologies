Session Technologies is a young consulting firm with roots in Barcelona and Amsterdam, that helps customers with their open source technologies adoption, by delivering different consultancy packages, check our [homepage](/) for more info.

Would you like to join Session Technologies?

## Why we’re different
There are many IT consulting firms out there, of different sizes, that aim to deliver asset-driven solutions; Session is different because:

- We practice and **master a wide range of technologies**, using the best tools to achieve a given objective, rather than adapting requirements to a specific stack
- **Strong engineering culture** across the board: everyone, including the CEO, can and will code review and help you grow as a technical person 
- High level of **trust and cohesiveness** of the professional network

## What are we looking for
We are looking for a young, talented and passionate individual who wants to expand their knowledge by working on real projects, becoming part - since day 1 - of a team made of professionals with decades of experience on this field.

## What are you going to do
The candidate will be working with the Session team (remote or in person), designing, developing, testing and configuring solutions, using different technologies. Part of the time will be invested in research and development.

Following Agile methodology practices, the candidate will attend a daily meeting and will use internal chat systems to report on the progress made.

The candidate will experience different project roles, including customer-facing activities.

## What we offer
Below, some of the perks of working at Session Technologies.

- Working with **Open Source technologies**, within Open Source communities, and building a public curriculum, line by line (of code)
- Learning, using and **mastering cutting-edge technologies**, like TypeScript, Angular, Kubernetes, and many more
- Working with a **network of collaborators across Europe** (Amsterdam, London, Lisbon, Rome and others)
- Up to 20% time dedicated to **research and development**
- **Access to [Spaces co-working locations worldwide](http://spacesworks.com/)**: every Session team member can access any Spaces co-working space (worldwide) and meet with colleagues to work together
- **Working location/hours full flexibility**; can work from home, or any other location worldwide, at any time of the day and week, assuming this doesn’t negatively impact on delivery
- Be as a **key player in the team since the beginning**, with visibility on the entire delivery process
